GOAL:
Make an app that allows users to create multiple lists, or "Stashes", and add items to those lists.
This is to be used for organizational purposes and asset/item tracking.
Users should be able to log in and out, and while logged in, they should be able to create a Stash or edit an existing one.
Stashes should only need 1 value, and that is the Stash Name
The API route for CRUD functions on Stashes is /api/stashes/<stash_id>

Users should be able to click on an existing Stash to view the items in the Stash, ideally in another DataTable.
Users should also be able to edit the name of the existing Stash if needed.
Stash Items have options for multiple values, including Name, Type, Value, Purchase Date, Serial Number, and Quantity.
Only the Name is required. Quantity defaults to 1 unless specified otherwise.
API route for CRUD functions on items is /api/stashes/<stash_id/items/<item_id>.

I need to use the public API for pricecharting to search for each item by Name and display the current price, if there 
are results returned from their api.



ISSUES:
- Need to run "set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider" for the first time that I run "npm start" after opening VS Code
- create function for items not working, dict object not callable

TODO:
- Finish styling

- NOT IMPORTANT: If there is enough time, enable Google Login and figure out how to get users who are logged in that way
  to be able to add items to the database
