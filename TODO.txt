Get token from logged in user to pass onto API Routes

Create Stash Item Table

Figure out why links aren't automatically redirecting

If using google auth, figure out how to access information from google to pass in to database so that the google login can enter and view data (not important)

Figure out how to get stash_id from the selected Stash in the datatable to pass onto useGetItemData in FetchData and also the routes to create items

Figure out how to actually sign in/sign up from React form

Figure out why links aren't clickable until you refresh the page

Figure out how to incorporate the pricecharting api



I want to be able to either click on the Stash in the datatable, or at a 
minimum use the checkbox and a button to open a new datatable that displays all of the items in that stash
